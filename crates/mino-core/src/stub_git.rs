//! Shared body for a git surface that compiles but is not built yet.
//!
//! The sibling of [`crate::stub`], kept separate for the reason `GitTransport`
//! is separate from `Transport`: a transport whose filesystem half is built
//! and whose git half is not should be able to say so without one macro
//! answering for both. The remote-agent transport uses both today.
//!
//! Note what this does *not* do. An unbuilt git surface answers
//! `Unimplemented`; it does not answer "there is no repository here". Absence
//! and not-built-yet read the same in a quiet UI and are entirely different
//! facts, and only one of them is a bug waiting to be finished.

/// Generates `impl GitTransport` where every method returns
/// [`crate::TransportError::Unimplemented`] naming the transport and the
/// method. Replace methods one at a time as a transport is built out.
///
/// The branch and stash surfaces are supertraits, so this expands
/// [`crate::unimplemented_git_ref_transports`] too: a transport that has
/// built none of git writes one line, not three.
