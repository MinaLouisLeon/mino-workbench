//! The remote-agent transport - scaffolded, not built.
//!
//! Talks to a `mino-agent` daemon over WebSocket. Every method answers
//! `TransportError::Unimplemented { transport: RemoteAgent }`.
//!
//! Phase 2 plan: one request frame per trait method, one response frame per
//! result, and `PtyEvent` pushed unsolicited on the same socket. The frame
//! schema is written down once, in `crates/mino-agent/src/protocol.rs`, so
//! both ends are built against one definition.
//!
//! Blocking open task: the agent has no authentication yet, which is why it
//! binds to loopback only. This transport must not be pointed at a
//! non-loopback agent until the token handshake exists. See
//! docs/mino-workbench/endpoints.md.
