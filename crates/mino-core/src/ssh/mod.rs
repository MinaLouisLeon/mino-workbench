//! The SSH transport.
//!
//! Filesystem work goes over SFTP and shell work over SSH channels, which is
//! the remote counterpart of the local transport's split between `std::fs` and
//! a PTY. Both halves ride one authenticated connection.
//!
//! Three things are worth knowing before reading further:
//!
//! - **Host keys are checked.** [`handler`] verifies against `known_hosts` and
//!   refuses an unknown or changed key. There is no accept-anything mode.
//! - **No secret is ever held.** Authentication is a key file or an agent
//!   ([`session`], [`agent`]); nothing here reads a password or a passphrase,
//!   so there is nothing to leak to disk, a log or browser storage.
//! - **Listings are structured, not scraped.** `list_dir` and `stat` use SFTP
//!   rather than parsing `ls` output. That is a deliberate difference from the
//!   local transport, which prefers the Nushell channel: SFTP is always there,
//!   returns real metadata, and does not depend on `nu` being installed
//!   remotely. `run_structured` still drives Nushell, for the breadcrumb and
//!   anything else that wants typed values.
