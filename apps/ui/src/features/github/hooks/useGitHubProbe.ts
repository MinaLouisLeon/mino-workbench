/**
 * The one cheap question, asked once per session and remembered.
 *
 * The shape mirrors `useGitStatus`, deliberately: one call on mount, four
 * possible answers, and every surface reading the result rather than asking
 * again. What is different is what triggers a re-ask. Git re-reads on a save
 * and on window focus, because the working tree changes under it. Nothing
 * about `gh` being installed or a remote pointing at GitHub changes while
 * somebody is typing, so this asks on:
 *
 * - the session changing,
 * - the branch changing - because every section is scoped to a branch,
 * - an explicit refresh.
 *
 * And on nothing else. There is no timer, and no focus listener: coming back
 * to the window is a reason to re-read a working tree and not a reason to
 * spend somebody's API budget.
 *
 * The branch comes from the git status the rest of the workbench already
 * reads, rather than from a second call. Two readings of the same branch could
 * disagree, and the header is the one showing it.
