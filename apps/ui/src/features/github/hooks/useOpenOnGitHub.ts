 * #19: this file, this line, on github.com.
 *
 * Two steps, and they are two on purpose. Rust asks `gh` where the file lives
 * and answers with a **URL**; this hands that URL to the operating system's
 * browser through the desktop opener. A transport method called `query` that
 * launched a browser as a side effect would be a surprise, and a page that
 * navigated itself to an address GitHub supplied would be a page somebody else
 * can steer.
 *
 * The line is read at the moment the button is pressed, from the editor, by
 * `currentLine`. Nothing tracks the cursor before then.
 *
 * The branch is the one that is checked out, not the repository's default. A
 * link to the line you are looking at, on a branch that does not have your
 * change, is a link to the wrong line.
