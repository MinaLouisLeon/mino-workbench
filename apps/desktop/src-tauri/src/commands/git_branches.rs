//! The branch commands. Dispatch only, like every command in this module.
//!
//! Split from `git.rs` the way the core trait is split: branches are the first
//! thing on this interface that changes files under the *other* panes, and
//! keeping them in their own file is what makes that visible rather than
//! buried in a list.
//!
//! Nothing here decides when the panes refresh. That is one event in the UI,
//! fired after the call returns, so every pane learns at the same moment
//! instead of each guessing - see `docs/mino-workbench/git-module.md`.
