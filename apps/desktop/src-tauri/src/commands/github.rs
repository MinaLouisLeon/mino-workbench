//! The GitHub commands. Dispatch only, like every command in this module.
//!
//! Two commands for five features, because the surface is two trait methods
//! for five features: the caller picks a `GitHubQuery` variant and Rust owns
//! the program text behind it. Ten commands here would be ten places for the
//! same dispatch to be written out.
//!
//! **No credential passes through here**, and there is none to pass. Every
//! call ends in a `gh` process that owns its own authentication in the
//! operating system keychain - see `mino_core::github`. Nothing in this file
//! reads, holds, forwards or logs a token.
